## Overview 

A small forum where you can post about your interests. This site supports the ability to sign up / log in to an account, publish threads, and comment on threads. Possible implementation of direct messaging will be added in the future.

## Getting Started

You will need to have React and NodeJS as they serve as the front and back end of the application respectively.

After installation, you will have to install the Express, CORS, and Nodemon libraries. Express allows us to easily build our web application with NodeJS, CORS is used to communicate with different domains, and Nodemon is used to restart the server when a change is detected in the injex.js file

To download these libraries, you can run the following command

```
npm install express cors nodemon
```
